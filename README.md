# Income and Expense Tracker Application

## Project Proposal
*The Income and Expense Tracker Application* will help users manage their personal finances by providing features such as, **Income Tracking**, **Expense Tracking**, and **Budget Management**.The application can cater to a broad user base, including: students, individuals and families.
